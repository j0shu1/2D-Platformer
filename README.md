# 2D Platformer

This is a basic game in which the player is a square that can move and jump. Move with WASD or arrow keys, and jump with spacebar. Press Esc to pause.

This was created as a way for me to learn some of the ins and outs of the Unity game engine.

Unfortunately I was unable to upload the entire Unity project to GitHub so it is unavailable.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Add goal object to move to next level
* Create level design for multiple levels
* Add moving aspects of levels
* Add enemies that hurt the player
* Add simple weapon mechanics
* Add weapons of different types
* Explore! See what I can come up with. I am interested in messing with some kind of game mechanic that uses the TimeScale.
